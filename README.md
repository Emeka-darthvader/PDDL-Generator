# PDDL-Generator
This is a PDDL Generator written to generate files for planning when minimal input is supplied
I wrote this sometime last year to help generate my PDDL files automatically. It was built using HTML, CSS (also incorporated bootstrap),JS and PHP for the backend.
I also used MySQL for the database 

I used Vanilla PHP (I know I know its basic ðŸ˜¢) and normal authentication, hopefully I have more time to make changes and upgrade it

I am ready to collaborate with anyone on making this solution better. 

My thought process on making this is documented on my blog

#How To Install
Here are some steps
1. Clone to your repo
2. The database(in SQL) is in the SQL-Files folder
3. Import the SQL file there to your database
4. Change your connection to the database (if necessary) in the dbconnect.php file
5. Enjoy the Software

Have Fun.
